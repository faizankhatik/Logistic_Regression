# Logistic Regression Project

A machine learning project using Logistic Regression to solve a classification problem.

## Description

This project explores Logistic Regression, a fundamental classification algorithm. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation of performance metrics

The Jupyter Notebook (`Logistic_Project.ipynb`) contains step-by-step explanations and code implementations.

## Installation

Before running the notebook, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install common dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Logistic_Project.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Example Output

The notebook includes model accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and visualization of results.
